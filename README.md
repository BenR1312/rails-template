## Terminology

Avoid the use of the terms "Staff", "Admin" and "Student" as they have meanings in the curtin university context that don't apply to the users of this app. For example: volunteering "staff" may not be curtin "staff" or the converse.

The system should instead use:

  1. Volunteer (someone who volunteers for projects)
  2. Project Co-ordinator (someone who co-ordinates projects)
  3. System Manager (someone who manages this system)
